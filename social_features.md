# 🤝 Social Features on Starship

Starship isn’t just about stealth browsing and games — it’s also built for connecting with your friends and sharing your online vibe.

Here’s everything you need to know about the social side of Starship.

---

## 1. Adding Friends

- To add someone as a friend, **both users must follow each other** (mutual followers).
- Once you become mutual followers, you automatically appear on each other’s friends list.
- This mutual-follow system keeps your social graph private and intentional.

## 2. Activity Status & Presence

Friends can see your **activity status** based on your settings:

- **Online/Offline:** Shows whether you are currently active on Starship.
- **What you’re playing:** Displays which unblocked game you are currently playing.
- **What you’re watching:** Shows if you’re watching a video on StarTV.
- **Other activity:** If you’re browsing or using other Starship features, friends can see a general “active now” status.

You control what your friends can see with **privacy settings** in your profile.

## 3. Profiles

Every user on Starship has a customizable profile page where you can showcase:

- **Profile picture (PFP):** Upload or select your avatar.
- **Bio:** Write a short personal description or status.
- **Badges:** Earn and display badges for milestones, achievements, or contributions.
- **Activity feed:** See your recent activity (games played, videos watched, etc.) if you choose so.

Profiles serve as your public identity on Starship, so feel free to make it yours!

## 4. Privacy & Control

Starship respects your privacy and lets you control your social presence:

- Choose whether your activity status is visible to friends, everyone or completely hidden. Your choice.
- Enable **Private Profile** to completely hide your status, activity, bio, and profile picture from everyone. With this setting on, your profile will also become unsearchable to others.
- Manage all data that's yours, and delete it.
- Data is kept secure and anonymized — no unnecessary tracking or sharing outside the platform.

## 5. How It Works Behind the Scenes

- Friends and follows are managed in the backend via a **mutual followers system**.
- Activity statuses update in real time when you play games, watch videos, or browse.
- Profile data (bios, badges, avatars) is stored and synced securely via Supabase.
- All connections and activities respect your settings and encryption standards.
